 *
 * An admin's /pro dashboard was an ORGANISER dashboard with bigger numbers:
 * the same four tiles (encaissé, billets, entrées), summed across everyone
 * because scope.any widens the query. That answers "how are my events
 * doing", which an admin does not have. It does not answer how many
 * organisers exist, whether anyone is waiting for approval, how many of
 * them have never sold anything, or whether refunds are climbing.
 *
 * Gated on scope.any AND finance.view, not users.manage: this is money
 * across every organiser on the platform, so the two capabilities it
 * actually needs are "may act beyond your own rows" and "may see revenue".
 * users.manage is about editing accounts, which is a different question.
