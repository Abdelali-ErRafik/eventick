/**
 * CMI callback — the ONLY thing that turns a payment into tickets.
 *
 * The buyer's browser is never trusted for this: it can lie, close the tab, or
 * lose its network right after paying. CMI calls this endpoint server to
 * server, and it is also where a payment that succeeded on a closed tab still
 * gets its tickets.
 *
 * The endpoint is necessarily public and unauthenticated — CMI has no bearer
 * token to present — so the signature IS the authentication. A POST with a bad
 * or missing hash is a forgery attempt, not a payment, and is refused before
 * anything is read out of the body. Several CMI integrations in the wild check
 * only ProcReturnCode, which means anyone who guesses an order reference gets
 * free tickets.
 *
 * CMI posts form-encoded, not JSON, and expects a bare text reply:
 * "ACTION=POSTAUTH" to accept the transaction, anything else to refuse it.
