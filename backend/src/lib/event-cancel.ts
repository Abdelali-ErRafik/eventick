/**
 * Calling an event off.
 *
 * `EventStatus.CANCELLED` existed in the schema from the start and NO route
 * ever set it, so an organiser cancelling a festival had to refund buyers one
 * order at a time. That is the most stressful hour in ticketing and the
 * product had no answer for it.
 *
 * The shape of this deliberately mirrors what actually happens on the day:
 *
 *  - Take the event off sale FIRST, in its own write. Everything after this is
 *    slow (refunds, email), and leaving tickets buyable while the refunds run
 *    would sell seats to an event that no longer exists.
 *  - Refund every paid order, one at a time, through the ordinary refundOrder
 *    path. Not a bulk UPDATE: each refund has to void its tickets, record its
 *    own reference and respect the compare-and-swap that stops a buyer being
 *    paid twice — reimplementing that in a loop is how a mass refund becomes a
 *    mass double-refund.
 *  - Keep going when one fails. A single bad order must not leave the other
 *    four hundred buyers unrefunded; the failures are returned so someone can
 *    finish them by hand.
