/**
 * The audit trail — who did what, to whom, and when.
 *
 * Only for actions where "it just changed" is not an acceptable answer: a role
 * change, a permission grant, a refund, a plan assignment, a payout, an
 * account deletion. Reads and ordinary CRUD stay out deliberately — a log that
 * records everything is one nobody reads, and the value here is that every row
 * is something a person should be able to account for.
 *
 * Recording NEVER fails the action it describes. An admin refunding a buyer
 * must not get a 500 because the log insert failed; the refund already
 * happened, and losing the record is the lesser harm. So every write is
 * fire-and-forget with its own catch, and a failure is logged loudly instead.
 */

/**
 * The action vocabulary.
 *
 * A closed set, not free strings: the journal is filtered and grouped by
 * these, so a typo would silently create a category nobody is looking at.
 * Dotted and past-tense — subject first, so related actions sort together.
