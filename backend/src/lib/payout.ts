/**
 * Payouts — what the platform owes an organiser, and the record of sending it.
 *
 * Eventick collects the whole ticket price through CMI, so every dirham a
 * buyer pays arrives in the PLATFORM's merchant account, not the organiser's.
 * The organiser's share therefore has to be transferred to them separately,
 * and this is the ledger for that. Before this existed, the dashboard showed a
 * "Reversement" step that computed nothing and recorded nothing.
 *
 * Two rules hold the integrity together:
 *
 *  - An order belongs to at most ONE payout, enforced by a unique index on
 *    PayoutOrder.orderId rather than by a query. Two runs over overlapping
 *    periods therefore cannot pay for the same tickets twice, even if they
 *    race.
 *  - A payout's totals are FROZEN when it is created. They are copied from
 *    the orders, not recomputed on read, so a refund processed next week
 *    cannot change the value of a transfer already made.
 *  - A plan's fixed monthly fee is charged at most ONCE per calendar month,
 *    enforced by a unique index on (organiserId, month) rather than by a
 *    query, so overlapping runs cannot bill the same month twice.
