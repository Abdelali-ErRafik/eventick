/**
 * Who may act on an order, and on the tickets inside it.
 *
 * Guest checkout means an order can have no customerId, and three route files
 * each answered that the same way:
 *
 *     const isGuestOrder = ticket.order.customerId === null;
 *     if (!isGuestOrder && ticket.order.customerId !== userId) throw 403;
 *
 * Read it closely and the guest branch does not check anything — it returns
 * the ticket to whoever asked. Anyone holding a guest ticket's id could cancel
 * it, rename its holder, exchange it, list it for resale or give it away.
 * "No account" had been implemented as "no check".
 *
 * The missing piece was never a user, it was proof. A guest has exactly one
 * thing a stranger does not: the link they were given at checkout. So that
 * link carries a secret — Order.accessToken — and it is the guest's
 * credential, playing the same role a session plays for a registered buyer.
 *
 * Three ways to be authorised, in the order they are checked:
 *   1. the order's access token (the buyer's link — works with no account);
 *   2. being the registered customer on the order;
 *   3. holding scope.any, i.e. staff acting on someone else's order.
