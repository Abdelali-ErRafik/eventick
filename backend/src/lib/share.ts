 * Sharing — give your ticket to someone else, free.
 *
 * Mechanically this is resale minus the payment: the recipient opens a link,
 * enters their name, and gets a NEW ticket with a fresh QR while the sender's
 * is voided. No seat is created or released, so inventory is untouched.
 *
 * The claim step is the point. Simply emailing a PDF means one typo sends the
 * ticket to a stranger with no way back, and the sender's QR keeps working, so
 * two people arrive holding the same seat. Here nothing changes until someone
 * claims, and until then the sender can revoke.
 *
 * This replaces the old /tickets/:id/transfer, which marked the ticket
 * TRANSFERRED — a status the gate refuses — and never issued a replacement,
 * so transferring destroyed the ticket and gave the recipient nothing.
