/**
 * Removing an account.
 *
 * There are two honest outcomes, and which one applies is decided by the data
 * rather than offered as a choice:
 *
 *  - DELETED: the row is gone. Only for an account that leaves nothing behind
 *    that has to stay readable — no payouts, no events with sales.
 *  - ANONYMISED: the row stays, stripped of personal data. For an account
 *    entangled in money history. A buyer's order has to keep existing — the
 *    organiser was paid for it, the ticket may still admit someone, and the
 *    payout that settled it is a financial record — so erasing the row would
 *    either break those or quietly rewrite the books.
 *
 * Offering only a hard delete would mean either refusing most real accounts or
 * deleting financial history to satisfy the request. Anonymising keeps the
 * promise that matters (the person's details are gone) without the collateral.
